# Aurora User Documentation

Documentation for the functions of Aurora, a web application that can receive, virus check and validate transfers of digital archival records, and allows archivists to appraise and accession those records. For technical documentation including how to install Aurora, see the README in the base branch of this repository.

## Accessing the documentation
The content is accessible on [docs.rockarch.org](docs.rockarch.org), the central platform for the documentation of the Rockefeller Archive Center.
